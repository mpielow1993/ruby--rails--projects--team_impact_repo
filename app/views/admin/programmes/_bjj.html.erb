	        <h2>What is Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu?</h2>
        </section>
        <section>
	        <p> Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (or &lsquo;BJJ&rsquo; for short) is a martial art, combat sport, and a self-defence system that focuses on grappling and 
	        especially ground fighting. BJJ was conceived when Carlos Gracie and Luiz Fran&ccedil;a started to focus and expand upon Kodokan Judo ground
	        fighting (Newaza) fundamentals that were taught to them by Mitsuyo Maeda and Soshihiro Satake. Carlos Gracie is considered to be the 
	        founder and creator of Modern Jiu Jitsu (Gracie Jiu Jitsu/Brazilian Jiu Jitsu). Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu eventually developed into its own
	        unique art through the experimentations, practices, and adaptation from the Judo knowledge of Carlos and H&eacute;lio Gracie, who then passed 
	        their knowledge on to their extended family.</p>

	        <p>In 1993, the it was the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu that won over all other martial arts when Royce Gracie choked out Karate master 
	         Gerard Gordeau to win the first ever <%= link_to "Ultimate Fighting Championship", "http://uk.ufc.com", target: "_blank" %> event. Gracie was able to defeat much larger opponents from various 
	        martial arts backgrounds using a combination of fundamental BJJ techniques, and in doing so brought this art to the masses and ensured
	        that Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and the newly formed sport of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) became inseparable. To this day, 
	        proficiency in BJJ is considered mandatory for any aspiring MMA fighter.</p> 
	        <p>BJJ promotes the concept that a smaller, weaker person can successfully defend against a bigger, stronger assailant by using proper 
	        technique, leverage, and most notably, taking the fight to the ground and then applying joint-locks and chokeholds to defeat the other 
	        person. BJJ training can be used for sport grappling tournaments (in both the gi and without the gi) and MMA competition or, for the 
	        average person, simply as an effective means of self-defence.</p> 
	        <p>Since its inception in 1882, its parent art of Judo was separated from older systems of Japanese Jiu-Jitsu by an important difference 
	        that was passed on to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu: it is not solely a martial art, it is also a sport; a method for promoting physical fitness 
	        and building character in young people; and, ultimately, a way of life.</p>
	        <p>The best way to learn Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, whether you are an MMA fighter who wants to improve their groundwork, or are just looking 
	        for a new and fun way to work out, is to attend a class run by a qualified instructor. This will ensure you learn how to apply the 
	        techniques of BJJ properly and in the safest possible environment. All of our BJJ coaches here at Team Impact are highly qualified 
	        and experienced, with some still actively competing at a high level Instructors for more details).<p>

	        <h2>What is BJJ training like?</h2>
        </section>
        <section>
	        <p>Training involves a variety of methods and techniques. Each class begins with a thorough warm-up to ensure your muscles, joints and mind 
	        are ready for what follows. Students are then taught basic trips and throws, joint locks, chokes and submissions, as well as defences 
	        against these same techniques being used against them.</p>
	        <p>Techniques are initially taught against a non-resisting partner before sparring is allowed.
	        Sparring (commonly referred to as &lsquo;rolling&rsquo;) and live drilling play a major role in training. This is where individuals get the chance to 
	        apply what techniques they have learned against a resisting opponent, thus simulating a real-life situation. All of this is carried out 
	        under the strict supervision of the class instructor. Because BJJ involves no punching or kicking, serious injuries are rare. Techniques 
	        like locks and chokes can be applied at slow speeds and applied with low amounts of force which means that students should never be placed 
	        in dangerous situations during training.</p>
